                <p>
                    Libbie was created by a group of system development students at Malmö University. As part of
                    a 12-week agile software project, the team designed and built Libbie using Java, HTML/CSS,
                    and modern development practices like Scrum, version control, usability testing, and iterative
                    prototyping. The project represents not only a functioning web application, but also a
                    demonstration of collaboration, creativity, and passion for user-centered design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Let Libbie be your companion in building your personal library—and your literary connections.</strong>
                </p>
