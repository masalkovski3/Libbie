            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Libbie is a web application that allows users to create a personalized digital library.
                    Users have complete freedom to organize their books into custom shelves,
                    defining themes and genres according to their preferences. In addition to managing
                    their library, users can discover new books, read and write reviews, and participate
                    in public discussions about books.

                    Libbie also includes a social component where users can connect as friends and
                    follow each other's reading activities. The platform will recommend books based
                    on users past readings and interactions within the app.
                </p>

                <h2>Comparison with Existing Services</h2> <!-- Ta bort eller behålla?-->
                <p>
                    Libbie shares similarities with Goodreads, as both platforms allow users to
                    review and organize books. However, unlike Goodreads, which relies on
                    standardized lists, Libbie grants users full control over their bookshelves.
                    Furthermore, Libbie places a stronger emphasis on social interaction.

                    Libbie can also be compared to IMDb, but while IMDb primarily focuses on
                    collecting and presenting data about movies and TV series, Libbie offers a
                    more personalized and interactive experience where users actively engage in
                    book discussions and customize their library.
                </p>

                <h2>How it started</h2>
                <p>
                    Libbie started as a student project at Malmö University with the goal of
                    creating a user-friendly platform for literature enthusiasts. We discovered
                    that many book lovers lacked a simple way to organize their reading
                    experiences digitally and share them with like-minded individuals.
                </p>

                <h2>The team behind Libbie</h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of passionate students who love both books and technology.
                    Our goal is to build a community where literature is at the center and
                    where everyone can find their place.
                </p>
